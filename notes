Students will submit a publication to the ReScience journal: http://rescience.github.io/

We envision this project as a series of modules which could be incorporated into other courses or workshops.

The "collaborating with Git and GitHub" module does not depend on specific science background and would be 
a prerequisite for some of the other modules.

"Science Imaging" module could be incorporated into 
* Physics 2600A,Introduction to Medical Physics
* Physics 4662, Magnetic Responance Imaging
* Physics 4931, Advanced Experimental Physics
* Astronomy 2801, Stars, Galaxies and Cosmology
* Astronomy 9612, Fundamentals of Computation
Field-specific imaging modules wold also be incorporated into the above.

Other courses at Western that already cover some of this material:
* MedBio 3505, Fundamentals of Digital Imaging
* MedBio 4445, Digital Image Processing
* MedBio 4475, Medical Imaging
* MedBio 9515, Intro to Medical Imaging
* CS 4487/9587a, Algorithms for Image Analysis [website](http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Courses/CS4487a/)
